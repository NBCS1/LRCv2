bugs

Tracer, ROI in root vs in channel vs outside bug
next folder did not work
time scale wrong 
application change is wrong +1
does not work without tracer analysis
....test.csv created in main folder??

declare C1 and C2 in parameters

file pattern name and file extension to look for splitting

deal with raw tif, nd...

Remove tracer and set it as a small module just for us

hide layer once ROI is processed

check sd sem averages of averages

output file from compilation of conditions is completly wrong

original config.json is fucking edited when changing param manually!! add a restore default button
